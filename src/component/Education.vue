              In 9th grade teacher started learn us to python development and since this time I started learning programming and creating Minecraft mods.
              I liked to solve problems in physics and mathematics, as well as studying history.
              In 11th grade I decided to devote myself entirely to Java development.

              Java programming.
              This course helped me more in learning frameworks like Spring Boot, JavaFX and gave me the concept of MySQL database.
              I completed the course before anyone else, as I already knew the basics and was able to pass the final project and receive a certificate of successful completion of the course.
